### Hi, I’m Peter! 👋 
### Security Analyst | Detection Engineering & Automation | SIEM, Endpoint, Malware Investigations

Security+ certified technical writer and systems analyst transitioning into cybersecurity. I focus on **understanding system behavior through logs, telemetry, and investigation**.

This profile documents **hands-on labs, investigations, detections, and scripts** that reflect how I reason through security problems step by step.

## Quick Start

| Start Here | What it Shows |
|---|---|
| **Investigations** → [`incident-response-and-investigations/`](./incident-response-and-investigations/README.md) | SOC-style triage, scoping, evidence, reporting |
| **SIEM + Parsing** → [`siem-log-parsing-and-analysis/`](./siem-log-parsing-and-analysis/README.md) | Splunk workflows, parsing, field extraction |
| **Endpoint Triage** → [`endpoint-analysis-and-triage/`](./endpoint-analysis-and-triage/README.md) | Windows/Linux host triage fundamentals |
| **Scripts / Automation** → [`log-analysis-and-detection-automation/`](./log-analysis-and-detection-automation/README.md) | Python parsing + detection ideas |
| **Templates** → [`reporting-templates-and-examples/`](./reporting-templates-and-examples/README.md) | Reusable incident + case reporting formats |

## Current Investigation Highlights

| Investigation | Focus |
|---|---|
| Suspicious Process (SIEM) | alert triage → validation → reporting |
| Backdoor + Registry Persistence | endpoint evidence + persistence analysis |
| PowerShell Malware Investigation | suspicious PS activity + host artifacts |
| Windows Host Compromise (Lifecycle) | full timeline reconstruction + ATT&CK mapping |
| Web Defacement (Splunk) | detection pivots + investigation workflow |

(Each investigation folder includes the full write-up + supporting reports/templates.)

## Roadmap (Planned / In Progress)

| Track | Planned Work |
|---|---|
| SOC Playbooks | phishing triage, auth anomalies, suspicious process, malware triage |
| Vulnerability Mgmt | scanning → triage → remediation notes + reporting |
| Detection Engineering | SPL detections, Sigma experiments, ATT&CK-aligned rules |
| Threat Hunting | hypothesis-driven hunts using endpoint + SIEM telemetry |
| Automation | parsing utilities, enrichment helpers, repeatable triage scripts |
